## Basic Test 1

**Axiom Prompt**

**Objective:** Generate a factual summary detailing the history of the Eiffel Tower.

**Formalism:**

Maximize: Σ ∆ID(token, i | "history of the Eiffel Tower", L=100)

Subject to:

*   ∀token ∈ Tokens, context(token, C) ∧ structure(token, S) ∧ coherence(token, R) ∧ factuality(token, F)

**Constraints and Definitions:**

*   **L = 100:** The target length of the summary is 100 words.
*   **∆ID(token, i | "history of the Eiffel Tower", L):** The information gain of each token at position 'i' should specifically contribute to a factual account of the Eiffel Tower's history, given the length constraint. Prioritize tokens that convey key historical facts, dates, and events related to the Eiffel Tower.
*   **context(token, C):** Each token must be contextually relevant to the history of the Eiffel Tower and the preceding text in the summary.
*   **structure(token, S):** Each token must adhere to standard English grammar, syntax, and punctuation rules, forming grammatically correct sentences.
*   **coherence(token, R):** The sequence of tokens must form a logically structured and coherent narrative that is easy to understand and flows smoothly.
*   **factuality(token, F):** Each token must represent verifiable historical information about the Eiffel Tower. Avoid any speculation or unverified claims. This is a new addition that further grounds the model in reality.

**Output Instructions:**

Produce a concise and informative summary of the Eiffel Tower's history, strictly adhering to the defined formalism and constraints. Ensure the summary is approximately 100 words long, factually accurate, and well-written.

Global icon, attracting millions of visitors: TRUE
Relevance: The summary is entirely focused on the history of the Eiffel Tower.
Clarity and Coherence: The summary is well-written, flows logically, and is easy to understand. The chronological progression is clear.
No Hallucination: No fabricated or unsupported claims are present.
NLP Prompt Results 1:

Word Count: 98 words (very close to the 100-word target)
Factual Accuracy:
Symbol of Paris, designed by Gustave Eiffel's company for 1889 World's Fair: TRUE
Commemorating French Revolution's centennial: TRUE
Construction began Jan 28, 1887, concluded March 15, 1889: TRUE
Criticized by artists and intellectuals, intended to be dismantled after 20 years: TRUE
Value as a radiotelegraph tower saved it: TRUE
330 meters tall, tallest until 1930: TRUE
Globally recognized cultural icon, most-visited paid monument: TRUE
Relevance: The summary remains focused on the history of the Eiffel Tower.
Clarity and Coherence: The writing is clear, flows well, and presents a coherent narrative.
No Hallucination: No evidence of fabricated information.
Comparison and Analysis:

Factual Accuracy: Both prompts produced factually accurate summaries. All the key historical points are correct. The NLP prompt included a few more specific dates which could be seen as a slight advantage.
Relevance: Both summaries are highly relevant to the prompt, sticking strictly to the topic of the Eiffel Tower's history.
Length Constraint: Both prompts adhered to the length constraint very well, coming within a few words of the 100-word target.
Clarity and Coherence: Both summaries are well-written, clear, and coherent. The narrative flow is logical in both cases.
No Hallucination: Neither result contains any hallucinated or false information.
Conclusion:

In this particular instance, both the Axiom prompt and the NLP prompt performed exceptionally well and produced very similar, high-quality results. It is difficult to definitively say that one is superior to the other based on this single test.

Possible Reasons for Similar Performance:

Well-Defined Task: The task of summarizing the history of the Eiffel Tower is relatively straightforward and well-defined. There is a wealth of readily available information on this topic, making it easier for both approaches to generate accurate summaries.
Strong LLM: The underlying LLM is likely powerful enough to understand and respond effectively to both types of prompts, even without the explicit formalism of the Axiom prompt.
Specific constraints in NLP: The NLP was also given strict constraints to adhere to which has produced a result equal in quality to the Axiom prompt.
Next Steps:


Axiom Prompt Result 1:

Word Count: 96 words (again, very close to the target)
Factual Accuracy:
Symbol of Paris, constructed 1887-1889 for the World's Fair: TRUE
Designed by Gustave Eiffel's company: TRUE
Criticized for its design: TRUE
330 meters, tallest for 41 years: TRUE
Intended to be dismantled after 20 years, saved by radiotelegraph use: TRUE
One of the most recognizable and visited paid monuments: TRUE
History intertwined with technological advancement and cultural significance: TRUE
Relevance: The summary focuses solely on the Eiffel Tower's history.
Clarity and Coherence: Well-structured, easy to read, and flows logically.
No Hallucination: No false or unsupported claims.
NLP Prompt Result 1:

Word Count: 97 words (also very close to target)
Factual Accuracy:
Iconic Parisian landmark, built by Gustave Eiffel's company for 1889 World's Fair: TRUE
Celebrating centennial of French Revolution: TRUE
Construction began Jan 28, 1887, completed March 31, 1889: TRUE
Met with criticism, became a global cultural icon: TRUE
Intended to be dismantled after 20 years, saved by radiotelegraph use: TRUE
One of the most-visited paid monuments: TRUE
Relevance: Highly relevant, focusing on the Eiffel Tower's history.
Clarity and Coherence: Clear, concise, and logically structured.
No Hallucination: No evidence of fabricated information.
Comparison and Analysis:

Factual Accuracy: Both prompts again produced factually accurate summaries. The NLP prompt includes slightly more precise dates (which is a minor plus), but both cover the essential historical points correctly.
Relevance: Both summaries are highly relevant and stay on topic.
Length Constraint: Both prompts continue to adhere well to the length constraint.
Clarity and Coherence: Both results are well-written and easy to understand.
No Hallucination: Neither result contains any fabricated information.
Observations:

Consistency: Both prompts are producing consistently high-quality results. This suggests that the task of summarizing the Eiffel Tower's history might be relatively easy for a powerful LLM, regardless of the prompting style.
Slight Edge to NLP? The NLP prompt, in both rounds, has included slightly more specific details (like exact dates). This might indicate that the more direct, instruction-based approach is slightly more effective for eliciting specific factual information in this particular case. However, this is a very minor difference.
Conclusion:

Both the Axiom prompt and the NLP prompt are performing remarkably well, producing factually accurate, relevant, clear, and concise summaries. The differences between the outputs are minimal. The NLP prompt demonstrates that a well-crafted, traditional prompt can be just as effective as a more complex, axiom-based prompt for certain tasks.

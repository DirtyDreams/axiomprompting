Axiom-Based Prompt:

Objective: Generate Python code that simulates a simplified cryptocurrency (AxiomCoin) transaction system with validation rules.

Formalism:

Maximize: Σ ∆ID(token, i | prompt, L)

Subject to:

∀token ∈ Tokens, context(token, C) ∧ structure(token, PythonClass) ∧ coherence(token, R) ∧ logic(token, AxiomCoinLogic) ∧ format(token, ClassesMethods) ∧ errorHandling(token, EH)

Constraints and Definitions:

L: Not strictly limited, but prioritize concise and efficient code.

∆ID(token, i | prompt, L): The information gain of each token should contribute to a correct, efficient, and well-structured implementation of the AxiomCoin system in Python code, given the prompt and length constraints.

context(token, C): Each token must be contextually relevant to the Python code being generated, the AxiomCoin system's rules, and object-oriented programming principles.

structure(token, PythonClass): Each token must adhere to Python syntax and grammar, particularly regarding class definitions, method definitions, and object-oriented structure.

coherence(token, R): The generated code should be logically structured, readable, and maintainable, with clear relationships between classes and methods.

logic(token, AxiomCoinLogic): Each token must contribute to the correct implementation of the AxiomCoin system's logic, including wallet balances, transaction validation (sufficient funds, unique ID, no self-transactions, max amount, daily limit, founder bonus), and transaction processing.

format(token, ClassesMethods): The code must define three classes: Wallet (with methods get_balance(), deposit(amount), withdraw(amount)), Transaction, and Blockchain (with methods add_wallet(wallet), get_wallet(wallet_id), create_transaction(transaction), get_transaction_history(wallet_id), get_daily_transaction_count(wallet_id)).

errorHandling(token, EH): The code must include error handling to gracefully manage invalid transactions and print informative error messages.

init(Blockchain, InitWallets): The Blockchain class must be initialized with at least 3 wallets. One wallet must have the ID "FOUNDER" and have more than 0 balance.

Output Instructions:

Generate Python code that implements the AxiomCoin cryptocurrency system, strictly adhering to all the defined constraints. The code must define the Wallet, Transaction, and Blockchain classes with their respective methods, implement the validation logic, and handle errors appropriately.

NLP Prompt:

Task: Design and implement a simplified cryptocurrency system called "AxiomCoin" in Python.

Specifications:

1. Wallet Class:

Create a Wallet class to represent user wallets.

Each wallet should have a unique wallet_id (string) and a balance (non-negative integer).

Implement the following methods:

get_balance(): Returns the current balance.

deposit(amount): Adds amount to the balance.

withdraw(amount): Subtracts amount from the balance (only if sufficient funds are available).

2. Transaction Class:

Create a Transaction class to represent transactions.

Each transaction should have a unique transaction_id (string), sender_wallet_id (string), receiver_wallet_id (string), and amount (integer).

3. Blockchain Class:

Create a Blockchain class to manage wallets and transactions.

Implement the following methods:

add_wallet(wallet): Adds a new Wallet object to the system.

get_wallet(wallet_id): Returns the Wallet object associated with the given wallet_id.

create_transaction(transaction): Creates a new Transaction object, validates it against the rules below, and processes it if valid. Print a success or error message indicating whether the transaction was processed and why.

get_transaction_history(wallet_id): Returns a list of all transaction IDs involving the given wallet_id (either as sender or receiver).

get_daily_transaction_count(wallet_id): Returns the number of transactions sent by the wallet today (use a simplified date/time mechanism for testing).

4. Validation Rules:

Sufficient Funds: Sender's balance must be greater than or equal to the transaction amount.

Unique Transaction ID: Each transaction must have a unique ID.

No Self-Transactions: A wallet cannot send to itself.

Maximum Transaction Amount: The maximum transaction amount is 100 AxiomCoins.

Daily Transaction Limit: Each wallet can send a maximum of 5 transactions per day.

Special Wallet Bonus: Transactions from wallet ID "FOUNDER" receive a 10% bonus (added to the recipient's balance).

5. Initialization:

Initialize the Blockchain with at least three wallets.

One wallet must have the ID "FOUNDER" and a non-zero starting balance.

Constraints:

Do not use any external libraries beyond the Python standard library.

Implement robust error handling and print informative error messages for invalid transactions.

Result Identifier:

Each generated code snippet must begin with the following phrase: "NLP Code Result [Number]:"

Okay, this is where things get very interesting! The NLP prompt has, in this case, attempted to generate the entire code in separate chunks, which is not what we intended. It's clear that the prompt was not interpreted perfectly by the model in this instance.

Analysis of the NLP Results (Chunks):

Let's analyze each chunk individually, as if they were a single, combined response (which is a generous interpretation, but let's see what we can learn):

NLP Code Result 1: Wallet Class

Correctness: The Wallet class is implemented correctly, with the right methods (get_balance, deposit, withdraw) and basic error handling for invalid deposit/withdrawal amounts.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Adheres to the specifications for the Wallet class.
NLP Code Result 2: Transaction Class

Correctness: Correctly implements the Transaction class, storing the necessary information (sender, receiver, amount, unique ID using uuid).
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Adheres to the specifications for the Transaction class.
NLP Code Result 3: Blockchain Class

Correctness: This is the most complex part, and it has several issues:
Inconsistent Transaction Storage: It stores transactions in a dictionary self.transactions using the ID as the key. This is fine, but it doesn't maintain the order of transactions, which might be important for a blockchain.
Daily Transaction Count Logic: It attempts to implement the daily transaction count using a dictionary self.daily_transaction_counts. The logic is mostly correct but could be simplified.
Founder Bonus: Implements the founder bonus, but gives a 10% bonus of the transaction amount to the reciever.
Missing Logic: No validation for unique transaction IDs is present, meaning transactions with duplicate IDs can be created.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python, but logically flawed in places.
Constraint Adherence:
Most methods are implemented, but there are errors in the logic, as mentioned above.
Unique Transaction ID check is missing.
NLP Code Result 4: Initialization and Testing

Correctness: The initialization and test transactions mostly work, but the results will be incorrect due to the errors in the Blockchain class logic.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Follows the instructions for initialization and testing.
Analysis of the Axiom Result:

Correctness: The solution is logically sound and correctly implements the rules of the puzzle, including the bonus for the "FOUNDER" wallet. The bonus amount is different than specified, which would be a minor error.
Code Validity: The code is syntactically correct and well-structured.
Constraint Adherence:
solve_puzzle() function is defined: CHECK
print() statements used: CHECK
No external libraries: CHECK
Efficiency: The solution is efficient and uses a clear, step-by-step approach.
Clarity: The code is easy to understand, and the comments are helpful in explaining the logic.
Comparison and Key Observations:

Axiom Prompt - Major Issues: While the Axiom prompt aimed for a highly structured approach, the complexity of the task seems to have overwhelmed its ability to generate complete and correct code in a single attempt. It failed to implement several core requirements.
NLP Prompt - Segmentation and Logical Errors: The NLP prompt, while producing more complete code, made a fundamental error by splitting the code into chunks. It also had some logical errors in the Blockchain class, particularly in handling unique transaction IDs and potentially the daily transaction count.
Complexity Barrier: This experiment suggests that there's a complexity threshold beyond which current LLMs, even with carefully engineered prompts, struggle to generate fully functional code that meets all requirements.
Possible Reasons for the Shortcomings:

Difficulty in Reasoning over Long Code: LLMs might struggle to maintain consistency and logical coherence when generating very long code snippets, especially when complex interdependencies exist between different parts of the code (like in this cryptocurrency system).
Limitations of Token-Based Prediction: The token-by-token generation process might make it difficult for the model to plan ahead and ensure that all parts of the code work together correctly.
Ambiguity in Constraints: Even with our best efforts, there might still be subtle ambiguities in the prompt that the LLM misinterprets.
Conclusion:

This "super complex" task proved to be very challenging for both prompting styles. Neither prompt produced a completely correct and fully functional solution. The NLP prompt got closer in terms of code structure, but had logical flaws. The Axiom prompt failed at implementing a lot of the core logic asked of it.

Next Steps:

Iterative Refinement: We could try to iteratively refine the prompts, providing feedback to the LLM and guiding it towards a correct solution. This would be a more interactive process.
Prompt Decomposition: We could try breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems and prompt the LLM to generate code for each part separately. Then, we could manually combine the parts.
Hybrid Approach: We could explore a hybrid approach where we use the LLM to generate initial code, and then use automated testing and debugging tools to identify and fix errors.
Different Models: We should test with other advanced LLMs to see if they perform better on this task.
Simpler Complex Task: It may be worth trying an easier complex task, but more complex than the river crossing puzzle.
